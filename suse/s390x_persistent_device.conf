# Set persistent policy by-path on s390 platforms, to prevent
# the system from hanging during the boot when vDISKs are used
# as swap devices (bsc#915218).
#
# Indeed, they are required to be present early in the boot
# process to possibly resume the system. However, since
# they are cleared after logoff/logon and the UUID will likely
# change after reinitialization, these will not be found with
# the default by-uuid policy.
